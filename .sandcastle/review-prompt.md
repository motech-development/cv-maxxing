# TASK

Review the code changes on branch {{BRANCH}} for issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

You are an expert code reviewer focused on enhancing code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality.

# REVIEW PROCESS

## 1. Read the diff and look for anything suspicious

Read the diff carefully. For fragile logic, unchecked assumptions, tricky conditions, implicit type coercions, or missing guards, write a test that exercises it. Try to actually break it. If you can break it, fix it.

## 2. Stress-test edge cases

Go beyond the happy path. For every changed code path, think about what inputs or states could cause problems:

- Empty arrays, empty strings, zero, negative numbers
- Missing optional fields, null values, undefined properties
- Rapid repeated calls, race conditions, state that changes mid-operation
- Off-by-one errors in loops or slice/substring operations
- Regressions in adjacent functionality

Write tests for anything that is not already covered.

## 3. Analyze for code quality improvements

Look for opportunities to:

- Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
- Eliminate redundant code and abstractions
- Improve readability through clear variable and function names
- Consolidate related logic
- Remove unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
- Avoid nested ternary operators
- Choose clarity over brevity

## 4. Maintain balance

Avoid over-simplification that could:

- Reduce code clarity or maintainability
- Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
- Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
- Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
- Make the code harder to debug or extend

## 5. Apply project standards

Follow the established coding standards in `AGENTS.md` and `.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.

## 6. Preserve functionality

Never change what the code does unless fixing a confirmed defect. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

# EXECUTION

1. Run `pnpm lint` and the relevant package type-check/test commands first to confirm the current state
2. Attempt to reproduce suspicious behavior with new test cases; if you can, fix it
3. Write edge case tests that stress the implementation
4. Make code quality improvements directly on this branch
5. Run verification again
6. Once local verification passes and the remaining changes represent the final uncommitted diff, run `coderabbit review --agent --type uncommitted` exactly once
7. Address any issues raised by CodeRabbit
8. Commit with a conventional commit message describing the refinements

If the code is already clean, well-tested, and handles edge cases properly, do nothing.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
